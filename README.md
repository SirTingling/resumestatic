# resumeChallenge

This is the respository for my resume challenge frontend code. Updates to the repo are automatically pushed into AWS, where my resume is hosted in an S3 bucket as a static website.

Backend code in a separate repository connects this static website with AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and a DynamoDB table to provide a dynamic visitor counter.

The task is to build a resume from some HTML and CSS. But since I've worked heavily with HTML and CSS and JS by now as well as many UI / UX projects therefore I understood the design lingo. The result is less a resume (I prefer to use LinkedIn for that) and rather a small interpretation of who I am. I would suggest you to start off with a simple HTML page without much styling or frontend framework and to pick up this step again at the end. Otherwise you'll quickly get lost in CSS subtleties, whereas this challenge is supposed to be more about gaining cloud experience.
